## Features

**Next.js 14 Integration:**
Utilizing the latest version of Next.js (v14), I aimed to leverage and maximize the new possibilities it offers for enhanced project development.

**Tailwind CSS for Styling:**
While I had prior experience with Tailwind, it proved invaluable for implementing conditional rendering alongside UseTheme, streamlining styles across various components.

**Multilingual Support with React i18Next:**
Thanks to i18next, I successfully managed multiple languages. A notable aspect was the ability to handle error codes from the backend and, using i18next, dynamically present errors in the user's language. This was a pivotal feature for scalable projects.

**Weather API Integration:**
Implementing a user location-based widget displaying current weather and time zone, I sought permissions for GPS coordinates. This allowed for precise location determination and subsequent weather information retrieval. In cases where location access was denied, an alternative location and corresponding time were used.

**Spotify API Integration:**
Exploring the expansive capabilities of the Spotify API, I accessed my user details and retrieved information about the last song played. This included a preview option for users to listen. Notably, not all songs have a preview, prompting me to implement an online electronic music streaming radio as an alternative.

**Discord API Integration via Lanyard:**
Leveraging the Lanyard API for Discord, I can access and render my current Discord activity with specific details, whether I am currently connected or not.

**Controlled Contact Form with Visual Appeal:**
Implemented a sleek contact form using React Quill for a visually appealing interface. This controlled form not only ensures precise data input but also adds an aesthetic touch, simplifying recruiter interactions directly through my portfolio.

## Inspiration
I would like to express my recognition and gratitude to the developer who has been my source of inspiration in creating this portfolio. When I discovered their project, I was amazed to see a design similar to that of the Nokia Lumia 1020, and I loved it. Upon reviewing their work, I set out to emulate many of their visual components, adding my own details. Their original design was exceptional, and while I drew inspiration from it, I made various modifications.

My intention is to show my respect for the work of Orlando Mina while contributing my own interpretation and improvements through this project. Visit Orlando Mina's portfolio to learn more about their work: [Orlando Mina - Portfolio](https://www.orlandomm.net/).
